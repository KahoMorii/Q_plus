# Q_plus
Q+: an algorithm for statistically quantifying sub-structure in star clusters

# INPUTS:
x,y: two-dimensional position of stars in parsecs

# OUTPUTS
[d,l,c]: estimated fractal dimension, number of levels, density scaling exponent
[d_err,l_err,c_err]: errors on  estimated fractal dimension, number of levels, density scaling exponent

# DOCUMENTATION
See paper for a ful explanation of the algorithm.
